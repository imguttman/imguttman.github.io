    <h3>A Concise Note on Ruby Hashes v. JS Objects</h3>
    <h5>Jan. 18, 2015</h5>

    <p>
      I saved over my blog post on this subject, meaning the three paragraphs I had written up about the difference between JS objects and Ruby hashes is gone. The gist of it was this: JavaScript objects are a collection of properities (each property is comprised of a name:value pair) that seem to be the same thing as Ruby Hashes. A hash is like a custom dictionary made up of key-value pairs. Despite these similarities, key-value pairs within hashes are encapsulated in a different way than object properties, and so JS objects differ in that they are more accessible. Apologies for such a short post. Believe me when I say the older one (RIP) was more descriptive and better written. I wish it was posted here as much as you do.
