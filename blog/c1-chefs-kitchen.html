    <h3>More Questions Than Answers</h3>
    <h5>Nov. 23, 2014</h5>

    <p>
      Some thoughts on DBC culture, its approach to learning, and how I’m feeling after week 1 of phase 0:
      <br></br>
      DBC Culture – Getting introduced to a new culture is always interesting and complicated, especially when you’re about to join that culture. A number of questions surface. Some are basic, like what is DBC culture and how does that culture manifest? Others not so much: how does the community treat or respond to actions/people that violate DBC culture? is the culture a list of practices/rules to be digested, learned, and lived throughout the program, or is there something that I need/want to contribute to the culture? is there something I want to push back against? am I even qualified to do so? It’s too soon to know the answers to any of these questions  - and I have a feeling that the breakneck speed of the course will get in the way of coming up with adequate answers. But they’re good to mull over. For now, suffice to say that the DBC culture I’ve been exposed to thus far has more positive attributes than negative. It’s one that strives for openness, honesty, and teamwork. That jives with me – I like the focus on honest communication (with others and yourself), reflection, and the idea that we can go farther together than we can alone; those are all things I want (read: need) to work on. I’m skeptical about some of the expectations that members of the DBC community are held to. Mandated external-facing assignments (like tweeting or blogging) certainly align with some DBC values (like reflection, active engagement with material, and collective learning). But the subtext of these assignments are do these things so employers think you’re a standup person, and I’m uncomfortable with the idea that this program isn’t just about becoming a word-class beginner, but also about assembling and packaging people to look good to employers. But maybe that’s paranoid, naïve, or both. We’ll see.
      <br></br>
      What I’m both excited and nervous about is DBC’s approach to learning, summed up beautifully by the restaurant-kitchen metaphor. It’s daunting to think/admit that I’ve been at been the typical restaurant-customer for the vast majority of my educational experiences. Those experiences have shaped expectations and behaviors that I’m hoping to ditch by the time we start phase 1. One struggle that I anticipate is the process of figuring out what success in the kitchen will look like. Sure, there are assessments at the end of each phase – but to me, that’s more restaurant-style stuff.  The restaurant-style education breeds a need for official validation, which often explicitly ranks you against your peers. In the kitchen, where the onus is on you to experiment with and contribute to your own learning experience, what are the signs of success?
