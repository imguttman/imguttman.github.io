    <h3>Asking the Right Questions</h3>
    <h5>Feb. 1, 2015</h5>

    <p>

      Back in the day, I thought asking questions in class would make me a better student. I made a conscious effort to ask questions and would feel a little pang of stress if class expired without me prodding my teacher for some extra (ranging from tangential to totally extraneous) piece of information. Yes, I was annoying. And I won’t say how long ago I mean when I say “back in the day.”

      <br></br>
      In question-asking, like most things, quality trumps quantity - especially on the internet, where your question is one of millions posted that day and exists in a competition for enlightened users’ attention, a question needs to be thoughtful. Thoughtful questions will have the following attributes:
      <br></br>

        - A specific and keyword-heavy title
              <br></br>

        - A concise problem statement that provides detailed context (including the research you’ve done before asking this question)
              <br></br>

        - Standalone code that demonstrates the problem (this should come after the problem statement)
              <br></br>

        - Good grammar, spelling, and formatting


        <br></br>

      Minus the blog, I’m internet shy. I’ll likely have to get over that. Looking back on the question (yes, singular…) that I asked to the group, I see a couple of components that could improved. First off my question is buried in a paragraph. I probably could’ve led with it, and then spaced out the rest of the content so that it could be more inviting and readable. Second, some of the content in the paragraph is irrelevant to the question at hand, stuff that could be trimmed so that readers could focus on what’s important. Last and most embarrassing, there was a typo in my question. Readers inevitably make judgments about you based on small errors like that (they don’t have much else to go off of) so the importance of proofreading should not be understated.
      <br></br>

      On the topic of readers’ judgments, one last piece of question-asking advice: be an active question-asker. Engage with the responses you get so that you can clarify and hone in on the problem. This makes it easier to find the path to an answer. And the sooner you find an answer, the sooner you can move onward and run into problems that beg more questions.
