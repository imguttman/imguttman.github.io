    <h3>Tech and Privacy</h3>
    <h5>Dec. 14, 2014</h5>

    <p>
      At the core of any debate regarding privacy and the tech community is the recognition that there is a perverse incentive at work. It’s widely accepted that a product (or industry) that has more information can better serves its users, and that users enjoy features that cater to them as individuals. So why not draw personal information of users to optimize their experience? Why is collecting information to improve a product (or enhance advertising so as to connect users to products they are more likely to be interested in) something to worry about
      <br></br>

      Understanding this incentive - and the ease with which tech companies can collect personal data - have led to a variety of predictions about the future of privacy and tech; many of them are of a dystopian bent.
      <br></br>

      One is that personal data will become so enmeshed in our tech products that the products will take on new importance in society, in the workplace, and in the courtroom. Products that collect data on its users defy the traditional transaction where an individual buys a product and retains full ownership of it. In today’s age, for the most part, your data is not your own when using an app or another tech product.
      <br></br>

      Others worry that the constant collection and monitoring of user behaviors will become more entrenched and invasive (however vague that sounds) and will be done in the name of improving the user experience, when it could be more accurately described as driving corporate profits.
      <br></br>

      It’s not exactly that these issues are little-discussed or flying under the radar. However, there’s certainly a feeling that consumers of these products/apps don’t fully understand what they’re sanctioning when they use a product. As apps become even more ubiquitous in our everyday lives, maybe the typical user won’t be paying attention to a firm’s privacy policy or won’t fully understand it even if he/she does. And even if the age of Orwell isn’t upon us, even if tech companies aren’t malicious or villainous or intentionally in cahoots with the government, certainly the architecture is in place to exploit and track millions of people without their knowing it.
      <br></br>

      These conversations aren’t new. But the latest round of debate was set off by revelations of a massive government data collection program, known as Prism, in which government obtained personal information - emails, texts, videos, etc - directly from massive tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo in order to spy on foreigners in the United States. The leak confirmed many people’s fears about privacy in the age of big data and also underscored the real need for the tech community to formulate and to abide by transparent privacy policies so that users can decide for themselves the true price of a product.
