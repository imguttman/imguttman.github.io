This blog is now taking a turn for the meta.

The subject today is learning about how we (or more specifically, other Concrete Random Learners) learn, and how to apply that knowledge. If you’re thrown off by the phrase Concrete Random Learner, then sit tight and power through this.

Anthony Gregorc is famous for his Mind Styles Model (MSM), which identifies four ‘types’ of learners. Two qualities determine a person’s learning type: that person’s perceptual quality and his/her ordering ability. For each quality, there are only two options. In determining someone’s perceptual quality, he/she can either be a concrete learner or an abstract learner. Someone’s ordering ability is either sequential or random. Hence the four learning types: Concrete Sequential (CS), Concrete Random (CR), Abstract Sequential (AS), Abstract Random (AR).

Now before moving on, I need to clarify: a person does not neatly fall into one of these four categories. Not even PhDs can make such sweeping generalizations. The online tests that identify your learning style don’t just assign you to a single category; they rank your affinity for each type. So when I referred to myself above as a Concrete Random Learner, I obscured the fact that my Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random scores were about as high as my Concrete Random score. With that said, it’s a pretty safe bet that the Abstract Sequential part of my brain can’t be trusted or relied upon.

Because I’m selfish and need to keep this blog-length, I’ll focus on Concrete Random Learners. Concrete Random Learners do best when they’re self-directed, use a trial-and-error approach, and able to compete with others. They struggle with routines, keeping detailed records, and re-doing a problem even after they’ve found a solution. Now if I was to read those last two sentences without ever having learned about Gregorc’s MSM, I don’t think I’d relate to those qualities at all. But the more I think about it, the more it makes sense.  It may be the case that I’m suffering from some confirmation bias now that I’ve accepted the CR label, but I don’t think being more deliberate about learning is a bad or dangerous thing. So I’ll proceed.

So how do I play to my strengths? I work independently - at least at the start - to dissect a problem. I don’t want to seem like I’m against collaboration. I’m not at all. The work I’ve done in groups is almost always of a higher quality than my individual work, mainly because it benefits from other points of view, critiques, and collective thought. But in my experience, it’s better to come prepared to a group discussion rather than start analyzing a problem as a group. It avoids the listlessness of free-rider problems, brings the problem into sharper focus, making the solution more attainable.

At first I wasn’t conscious/deliberate about my learning style in Phase 0, even though I had already taken the test. However, after a couple unproductive pairings that left me feeling too slow to contribute anything to my fellow FCs, I began to incorporate the tips for Concrete Random Learners. For the time being, they’re working.
