      <p>It is a joining a group of people together to program and solve solutions.
            By seperateing into distinct roles of <b>Driver and Navigator</b>.  You are sharing
            a computer.

    <div id="Why_is">
       <h5>Why is pair programming important to DBC</h5>
       <p>Pair programming limits errors, a second set of eyes cleans up the process, it
           expands the number of potential solutions by taking in a different perspective.  It
           is what DBC is all about.

       <h5>Compare Driver and Navigator</h5>
        <p><b>DRIVER:</b> Someone who litterally writes out the code.
            <b>NAVIGATOR:</b> Directs the driver on a certain part of the code, and lays
            out the steps to solve the problems.
