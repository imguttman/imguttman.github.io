        <section id="html" class="box">
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>All documents must start with the tag: !DOCTYPE html.</p>
            <p>The document itself begins with an  "html" tag and ends with "/html" tag.</p>
            <p>Each HTML document needs a "head" section demarcated by head tags. This section includes the website's title, link to a CSS stylesheet, and other important details that apply to the whole site </p>
            <p>The visible part of the document is between "body" and "/body" tags.</p>

        <section id="css" class="box">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML, it started a nightmare for developers. Development of large web sites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, was long and expensive.</p>
            <p>With CSS, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing just one file!</p>
            <p>The element selector selects elements based on the element name. For example, all style choices within a "p" selector will apply to all paragraph elements in the HTML document. </p>
            <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.</p>
            <p>The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
            <p>You can also group selectors to minimize the code. To do this, separate each selector with a comma. The CSS styling will apply apply to elements whose position in the document matches the order of selectors.</p>
